API authentication

API access is achieved with basic seeded Signature which is a HMAC-SHA256 encoded message containing: nonce, client ID and API key. The HMAC-SHA256 code must be generated using a secret key that was generated with your API key.

Note: you must logon to https://CEX.IO/r/0/Seerauber/0/ and go to your account / security and explicitly enable a new API key.

You will need as input for private functions:

  + Username  (ex: MyHaNDLeSensitivE)
  + API key
  + API secret key
